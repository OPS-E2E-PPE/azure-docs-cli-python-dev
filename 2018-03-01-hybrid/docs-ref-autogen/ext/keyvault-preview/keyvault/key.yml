  name: az keyvault key backup
  summary: Requests that a backup of the specified key be downloaded to the client.
  description: The Key Backup operation exports a key from Azure Key Vault in a protected form. Note that this operation does NOT return key material in a form that can be used outside the Azure Key Vault system, the returned key material is either protected to a Azure Key Vault HSM or to Azure Key Vault itself. The intent of this operation is to allow a client to GENERATE a key in one Azure Key Vault instance, BACKUP the key, and then RESTORE it into another Azure Key Vault instance. The BACKUP operation may be used to export, in protected form, any key type from Azure Key Vault. Individual versions of a key cannot be backed up. BACKUP / RESTORE can be performed within geographical boundaries only; meaning that a BACKUP from one geographical area cannot be restored to another geographical area. For example, a backup from the US geographical area cannot be restored in an EU geographical area. This operation requires the key/backup permission.

The RESTORE operation may be used to import a previously backed up key. Individual versions of a key cannot be restored. The key is restored in its entirety with the same key name as it had when it was backed up. If the key name is not available in the target Key Vault, the RESTORE operation will be rejected. While the key name is retained during restore, the final key identifier will change if the key is restored to a different vault. Restore will restore all versions and preserve version identifiers. The RESTORE operation is subject to security constraints: The target Key Vault must be owned by the same Microsoft Azure Subscription as the source Key Vault The user must have RESTORE permission in the target Key Vault. This operation requires the keys/restore permission.'
