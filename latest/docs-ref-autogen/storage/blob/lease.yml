- uid: az_storage_blob_lease_break
  name: az storage blob lease break
  summary: Breaks the lease, if the blob has an active lease.
  description: Once a lease is broken, it cannot be renewed. Any authorized request can break the lease; the request is not required to specify a matching lease ID. When a lease is broken, the lease break period is allowed to elapse, during which time no lease operation except break and release can be performed on the blob. When a lease is successfully broken, the response indicates the interval in seconds until a new lease can be acquired.   A lease that has been broken can also be released, in which case another client may immediately acquire the lease on the blob.

    description: ''
  - name: --lease-break-period
    summary: For a break operation, this is the proposed duration of seconds that the lease should continue before it is broken, between 0 and 60 seconds. This break period is only used if it is shorter than the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time remaining on the lease is used. A new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may be held for longer than the break period. If this header does not appear with a break operation, a fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
