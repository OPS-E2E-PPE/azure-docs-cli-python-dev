    description: ''
  - name: --id
    summary: A string that uniquely identifies the job within the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two IDs within an account that differ only by case).
    description: ''
  - name: --metadata
    summary: A list of name-value pairs associated with the job as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code. Space separated values in 'key=value' format.
    description: ''
  - name: --priority
    summary: The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0.
    description: ''
  - name: --uses-task-dependencies
    summary: Whether tasks in the job can define dependencies on each other. The default is false. True if flag present.
    description: ''
  - name: --job-max-task-retry-count
    summary: The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
    description: ''
  - name: --job-max-wall-clock-time
    summary: The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
    description: ''
  - name: --job-manager-task-command-line
    summary: The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.

  name: az batch job delete
  summary: Deletes a job.
  description: Deleting a job also deletes all tasks that are part of that job, and all job statistics. This also overrides the retention period for task data; that is, if the job contains tasks which are still retained on compute nodes, the Batch services deletes those tasks' working directories and all their contents.  When a Delete Job request is received, the Batch service sets the job to the deleting state. All update operations on a job that is in deleting state will fail with status code 409 (Conflict), with additional information indicating that the job is being deleted.

- uid: az_batch_job_disable
  name: az batch job disable
  summary: Disables the specified job, preventing new tasks from running.
  description: The Batch Service immediately moves the job to the disabling state. Batch then uses the disableTasks parameter to determine what to do with the currently running tasks of the job. The job remains in the disabling state until the disable operation is completed and all tasks have been dealt with according to the disableTasks option; the job then moves to the disabled state. No new tasks are started under the job until it moves back to active state. If you try to disable a job that is in any state other than active, disabling, or disabled, the request fails with status code 409.

After the this operation is completed, the job moves to the active state, and scheduling of new tasks under the job resumes. The Batch service does not allow a task to remain in the active state for more than 7 days. Therefore, if you enable a job containing active tasks which were added more than 7 days ago, those tasks will not run.

    summary: The action the Batch service should take when all tasks in the job are in the completed state. If omitted, the completion behavior is set to noAction. If the current value is terminateJob, this is an error because a job's completion behavior may not be changed from terminateJob to noAction. You may not change the value from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an 'invalid property value' error response. If you do not specify this element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an error if the current value is terminatejob.
