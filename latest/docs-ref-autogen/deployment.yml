    description: ''
  - name: --parameters
    summary: Supply deployment parameter values.
    description: Parameters may be supplied from a file using the `@{path}` syntax, a JSON string, or as &lt;KEY=VALUE&gt; pairs. Parameters are evaluated in order, so when a value is assigned twice, the latter value will be used. It is recommended that you supply your parameters file first, and then override selectively using KEY=VALUE syntax.
  - name: --template-file
    summary: A template file path in the file system.
    description: ''
  - name: --template-uri
    summary: A uri to a remote template file.
    description: ''
- uid: az_deployment_delete
  name: az deployment delete
  summary: Deletes a deployment from the deployment history.
  description: A template deployment that is currently running cannot be deleted. Deleting a template deployment removes the associated deployment operations. This is an asynchronous operation that returns a status of 202 until the template deployment is successfully deleted. The Location response header contains the URI that is used to obtain the status of the process. While the process is running, a call to the URI in the Location header returns a status of 202. When the process finishes, the URI in the Location header returns a status of 204 on success. If the asynchronous request failed, the URI in the Location header returns an error-level status code.
