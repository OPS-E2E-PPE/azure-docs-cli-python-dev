    description: ''
  - name: --max-connections
    defaultValue: "2"
    summary: If set to 2 or greater, an initial get will be done for the first self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE bytes of the file. If this is the entire file, the method returns at this point. If it is not, it will download the remaining data parallel using the number of threads equal to max_connections. Each chunk will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE. If set to 1, a single large get request will be done. This is not generally recommended but available if very few threads should be used, network requests are very expensive, or a non-seekable stream prevents parallel download. This may also be valuable if the file is being concurrently modified to enforce atomicity or if many files are expected to be empty as an extra request is required for empty files if max_connections is greater than 1.
    description: ''

    description: ''
  - name: --open-mode
    defaultValue: wb

    description: ''
  - name: --timeout
    summary: Request timeout in seconds. Applies to each call to the service.
    description: ''
  - name: --validate-content
    summary: If set to true, validates an MD5 hash for each retrieved portion of the file. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will already validate. Note that the service will only return transactional MD5s for chunks 4MB or less so the first get request will be of size self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE instead of self.MAX_SINGLE_GET_SIZE. If self.MAX_CHUNK_GET_SIZE was set to greater than 4MB an error will be thrown. As computing the MD5 takes processing time and more requests will need to be done due to the reduced chunk size there may be some increase in latency.
