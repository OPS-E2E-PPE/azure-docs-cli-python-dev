  - name: --priority
    summary: The priority of the job. Priority values can range from -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the highest priority. The default value is 0.

  - name: --job-max-task-retry-count
    summary: The maximum number of times each task may be retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0 (no retries).
    description: ''
  - name: --job-max-wall-clock-time
    summary: The maximum elapsed time that the job may run, measured from the time the job is created. If the job does not complete within the time limit, the Batch service terminates it and any tasks that are still running. In this case, the termination reason will be MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no time limit on how long the job may run. Expected format is an ISO-8601 duration.
    description: ''
  - name: --job-manager-task-command-line
    summary: The command line of the Job Manager task. The command line does not run under a shell, and therefore cannot take advantage of shell features such as environment variable expansion. If you want to take advantage of such features, you should invoke the shell in the command line, for example using "cmd /c MyCommand" in Windows or "/bin/sh -c MyCommand" in Linux.
