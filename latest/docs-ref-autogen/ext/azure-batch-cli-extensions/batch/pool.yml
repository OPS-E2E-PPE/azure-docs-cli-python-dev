  summary: Create a Batch pool in an account. When creating a pool, choose arguments from either Cloud Services Configuration or Virtual Machine Configuration.

  parameters:
  - name: --application-licenses
    summary: The list of application licenses the Batch service will make available on each compute node in the pool. The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool creation will fail.
    description: ''
  - name: --application-package-references
    summary: The list of application packages to be installed on each compute node in the pool.
    description: ''
  - name: --auto-scale-formula
    summary: A formula for the desired number of compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to false. It is required if enableAutoScale is set to true. The formula is checked for validity before the pool is created. If the formula is not valid, the Batch service rejects the request with detailed error information. For more information about specifying this formula, see 'Automatically scale compute nodes in an Azure Batch pool' (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-automatic-scaling/</a>).
    description: ''
  - name: --certificate-references
    summary: The list of certificates to be installed on each compute node in the pool. For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
    description: ''
  - name: --enable-inter-node-communication
    summary: Whether the pool permits direct communication between nodes. Enabling inter-node communication limits the maximum size of the pool due to deployment restrictions on the nodes of the pool. This may result in the pool not reaching its desired size. The default value is false.
    description: ''
  - name: --id
    summary: Required. A string that uniquely identifies the pool within the account. The ID can contain any combination of alphanumeric characters including hyphens and underscores, and cannot contain more than 64 characters. The ID is case-preserving and case-insensitive (that is, you may not have two pool IDs within an account that differ only by case).

  - name: --metadata
    summary: A list of name-value pairs associated with the pool as metadata. The Batch service does not assign any meaning to metadata; it is solely for the use of user code.

  - name: --resize-timeout
    summary: The timeout for allocation of compute nodes to the pool. This timeout applies only to manual scaling; it has no effect when enableAutoScale is set to true. The default value is 15 minutes. The minimum value is 5 minutes. If you specify a value less than 5 minutes, the Batch service returns an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

  - name: --target-dedicated-nodes
    summary: The desired number of dedicated compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.
    description: ''
  - name: --target-low-priority-nodes
    summary: The desired number of low-priority compute nodes in the pool. This property must not be specified if enableAutoScale is set to true. If enableAutoScale is set to false, then you must set either targetDedicatedNodes, targetLowPriorityNodes, or both.

    description: ''
  - name: --vm-size
    summary: Required. The size of virtual machines in the pool. All virtual machines in a pool are the same size. For information about available sizes of virtual machines for Cloud Services pools (pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration), see Sizes for Cloud Services (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/cloud-services-sizes-specs/</a>). Batch supports all Cloud Services VM sizes except ExtraSmall, A1V2 and A2V2. For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux) (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/</a>) or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows) (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/">https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/</a>). Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
