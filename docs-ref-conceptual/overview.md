# Azure CLI 2.0

The Azure CLI 2.0 is Azure's new command-line experience for managing Azure resources.
You can use it in your browser with [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview),
or you can [install](install-azure-cli.md) it on macOS, Linux, and Windows and run it from the command line.

Azure CLI 2.0 is optimized for managing and administering Azure resources from the command line, and for building automation scripts that work against the Azure Resource Manager. Using the Azure CLI 2.0, you can create VMs within Azure as easily as typing the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az vm create -n MyLinuxVM -g MyResourceGroup --image UbuntuLTS
```

Use the [Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/overview) to run the CLI in your browser,
or [install](install-azure-cli.md) it on macOS, Linux, or Windows.
Read the [Get Started](get-started-with-azure-cli.md) article to begin using the CLI.
For information about the latest release, see the [release notes](release-notes-azure-cli.md).
