# Install Azure CLI 2.0 with apt

If you are running a distirbution that comes with `apt`, such as Ubuntu or Debian, there is an available package
for the Azure CLI that you can install on your system.

[!INCLUDE [linux-install-requirements.md](includes/linux-install-requirements.md)]

## Install

1. Modify your sources list:

   - 32-bit system

     ```bash
     echo "deb https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ wheezy main" | \
          sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
     ```

   - 64-bit system

     ```bash
     echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/ wheezy main" | \
          sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
     ```

2. Run the following sudo commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver packages.microsoft.com --recv-keys 52E16F86FEE04B979B07E28DB02C46DF417A0893
   sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install azure-cli
   ```

You can run the Azure CLI with the `az` command.

## Update

Use `apt-get upgrade` to update the CLI package.

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> This will upgrade all of the installed packages on your system which have not had a dependency change.
> To upgrade only the CLI, use `apt-get install`.
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade -y azure-cli
> ```

### Uninstall

If you ever decide to uninstall the Azure CLI, we're sorry to see you go. Before you uninstall, use the `az feedback` command to give us
some reasons why you chose to uninstall and how we could improve the CLI experience. We want to make sure that the Azure
CLI is as bug-free and user-friendly as we can make it. You can also [file a github issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).

1. Uninstall with `apt-get remove`.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get remove -y azure-cli
    ```

2. If you do not plan to reinstall the CLI, remove the Azure CLI repository information.

   ```bash
   sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/azure-cli.list
   ```

3. Remove any unneeded packages.

   ```bash
   sudo apt autoremove
   ```
