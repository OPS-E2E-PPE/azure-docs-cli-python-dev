# Azure CLI 2.0 configuration

The Azure CLI 2.0 allows for user configuration to override internal settings such as logging and data collection, and provide default options for
some required parameters. The CLI offers a convenience command for managing some of these values, `az configure`, and other values can be set in a
configuration file or with environment variables.

Configuration values used by the CLI are evaluted in the following precedence, with items higher on the list taking priority.

1. Command-line parameters
2. Environment variables
3. Values in the configuration file or set with `az configure`

## CLI configuration with az configure

You set defaults for the CLI with the [az configure](/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest#az_configure) command.
This command takes one argument, `--defaults`, which is a space-separated list of `key=value` pairs. The provded values are used by the CLI in place of 
required arguments. 

The following is a list of available keys that you can use.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| group | The default resource group to use for all commands. |
| location | The default location to use for all commands. |
| web | The default app name to use for `az webapp` commands. |
| vm | The default VM name to use for `az vm` commands. |
| vmss | The default VMSS name to use for  `az vmss` commands. |
| acr | The default container registry name to use for `az acr` commands. |
| acs | The default container service name to use for `az acs` commands. |

As an example, here's how you would set the default resource group and location for all commands.

```azurecli
az configure --defaults "location=westus2 group=MyResourceGroup"
```

## CLI configuration file

The CLI configuration file contains other settings that are used for managing CLI behavior. The configuration file itself is located 
at `$AZURE_CONFIG_DIR/config`. The default value of `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` is `$HOME/.azure/config` on Linux and macOS,
and `%USERPROFILE%\.azure\config` on Windows. 

Configuration files are written in the INI file format. These files are made up of sections which start with a `[section-name]` header, followed by 
a list of `key=value` entries. Section names are case-sensitive and key names are not.
Comments are any line that begins with a `#` or `;`. Inline comments are not allowed. Booleans are case-insensitive, and are represented by the following values.

* __True__: 1, yes, true, on
* __False__: 0, no, false, off

Here's an example of a CLI configuration file which disables any confirmation prompts and sets up logging to the `/var/log/azure` directory.

```
[core]
disable_confirm_prompt=Yes

[logging]
enable_log_file=yes
log_dir=/var/log/azure
```

See the next section for details on all of the available configuration values and what they mean. For the full details on the INI file format,
see the [Python documentation on INI](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure).

## CLI configuration values and environment variables

The following table contains all of the sections and option names that can be placed in a configuration file. Their corresponding
environment variables can be set as `AZURE_{section}_{name}`, in all caps. For example, you can set the `batchai` section's `storage_account` default
in the `AZURE_BATCHAI_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` variable.

Any value with a default available does not have to be present in the command line arguments, even if it is required.

| Section | Name      | Type | Description|
|---------|-----------|------|------------|
| __core__ | output | string | The default output format. Can be one of `json`, `jsonc`, `tsv`, or `table`. |
| | disable\_confirm\_prompt | boolean | Turn confirmation prompts on/off. |
| | collect\_telemetry | boolean | Allow Microsoft to collect anonymous data on the usage of the CLI. For privacy information, see the [Azure CLI 2.0 Terms of Use](http://aka.ms/AzureCliLegal). |
| __logging__ | enable\_log\_file | boolean | Turn logging on/off. |
| | log\_dir | string | The directory to write logs to. By default this is `${AZURE_CONFIG_DIR}/logs`. |
| __storage__ | connection\_string | string | The default connection string to use for `az storage` commands. |
| | account | string | The default account name to use for `az storage` commands. |
| | key | string | The default account key to use for `az storage` commands. |
| | sas\_token | string | The default SAS token to use for `az storage` commands. |
| __batchai__ | storage\_account | string | The default storage account to use for `az batchai` commands. |
| | storage\_key | string | The default storage key to use for `az batchai` commands. |
| __batch__ | account | string | The default Azure Batch account name to use for `az batch` commands. |
| | access\_key | string | The default access key to use for `az batch` commands. Only used with `aad` authorization. |
| | endpoint | string | The default endpoint to connect to for `az batch` commands. |
| | auth\_mode | string | The authorization mode to use for `az batch` commands. Can be `shared_key` or `aad`. |

> [!NOTE]
> You may see other values in your configuration file, but these are managed directly through CLI commands,
> including `az configure`. The ones listed in the table above are the only values you should change yourself.
