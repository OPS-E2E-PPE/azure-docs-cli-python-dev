# Install Azure CLI 2.0

Install the new version of the Azure CLI today!
We've improved and updated it to provide a great native command-line experience for managing Azure resources.
It can be used on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
For information about the latest release, see the [release notes](release-notes-azure-cli.md).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the Azure Service Management (ASM) model, [install Azure CLI 1.0](/azure/cli-install-nodejs).

## <a name="macOS"/>Install on macOS

On macOS, you are able to install either with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or manually.

### Install with Homebrew

1. If you don't have it already, install Homebrew by following the [Homebrew installation instructions](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.html).

2. If you have previously installed the CLI manually, follow the [manual uninstall](#UninstallManually) instructions.

3. Update your local Homebrew repositories.

   ```bash
   brew update
   ```

4. Install the `azure-cli` package.

  ```bash
  brew install azure-cli
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you previously installed the Azure CLI 1.0 with Homebrew, instead of installing
> the package you can get CLI 2.0 through the regular Homebrew upgrade process.
>
> ```bash
> brew upgrade
> ```

### Install manually

## Install with Docker

We maintain a Docker image preconfigured with the Azure CLI 2.0.

Install the CLI using `docker run`.

   ```bash
   docker run -it azuresdk/azure-cli-python:<version>
   ```

See our [Docker tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/azuresdk/azure-cli-python/tags/) for available versions.

The CLI is installed on the image as the `az` command in `/usr/local/bin`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to pick up the SSH keys from your user environment,
> you can use `-v ${HOME}:/root` to mount $HOME as `/root`.

> ```bash
> docker run -it -v ${HOME}:/root azuresdk/azure-cli-python:<version>
> ```

## <a name="Linux"/>Install on Linux without a package manager

It is recommended that you install the CLI with a package manager if you are able to. If you do not want to add Microsoft's repositories, or are working with
a distribution which does not have a provided package, you can manually install the CLI.

1. Install the prerequisites based on your Linux distribution.

   ```
   Platform              | Prerequisites
   ----------------------|---------------------------------------------
   Ubuntu 15.10 or 16.04 | sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev build-essential
   Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04 | sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
   Debian 8              | sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev build-essential
   Debian 7              | sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y python libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
   CentOS 7.1 or 7.2     | sudo yum check-update; sudo yum install -y gcc python libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel
   RedHat 7.2            | sudo yum check-update; sudo yum install -y gcc python libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel
   SUSE OpenSUSE 13.2    | sudo zypper refresh && sudo zypper --non-interactive install curl gcc python python-xml libffi-devel python-devel openssl-devel
   ```

If your distribution is not listed above, you will need to install [Python 2.7 or later](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [libffi](https://sourceware.org/libffi/), and [OpenSSL 1.0.2](https://www.openssl.org/source/).

2. Install the CLI with  `curl`.

   ```bash
   curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCli | bash
   ```

3. You may have to restart your shell for some changes to take effect.

   ```bash
   exec -l $SHELL
   ```

4. Run the CLI from the command prompt with the `az` command.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an issue during CLI install, check this section to see if your particular case is covered. If your issue is not here, please [file a Github issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues).

### curl "Object Moved" error

If you get an error from `curl` related to the `-L` parameter, or an error message including the text "Object Moved", try using the full URL instead of the `aka.ms` redirect:

```bash
curl https://azurecliprod.blob.core.windows.net/install | bash
```

### `az` command not found

You may need to clear your shell's command hash cache. Run

```bash
hash -r
```

and see if the problem is resolved. The command may also not be in your `$PATH`. Make sure that `<install path>/bin` appears in your `$PATH`, and restart your shell if necessary.

## Uninstall CLI 1.x versions

If you have an earlier CLI 1.x version available on your system, you can uninstall it based upon the type of install used.

### Uninstall with npm

Remove the older CLI with `npm uninstall`.

  ```bash
  npm uninstall -g azure-cli
  ```

### Uninstall with distributable

If you installed via the [Azure CLI Installer (MSI)](http://aka.ms/webpi-azure-cli) or a [macOS package](http://aka.ms/mac-azure-cli), use the same tool to remove your install.

### Uninstall with Docker

If you installed a Docker image to use the earlier CLI version, remove that image and any associated containers. You can then re-create the containers
after installing the new Docker image as described in the install instructions.

  ```bash
  docker rmi -f microsoft/azure-cli
  ```
